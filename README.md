# Mathematical-Finance
Final Project in upper level math course Math 86: Mathematical Finance. 

Completed as a group with Charlie Morris and Zach Wange.

The paper here delves into options trading during earnings events, examining the relationship between market sentiment, implied volatility, and actual stock moves. It uncovers a link between negative implied volatility skew and increased earnings dispersion. The analysis emphasizes the reliability of implied volatilities in reflecting market expectations, especially during heightened volatility. Finally, it discussed the parameter which would inform an effective straddle selling strategy around EAD (Earnings Events Days).

The data used in the project on option prices, earning dates, etc was primarily downloaded from Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS),
and then cleaned for the use of the project.

In this directory also is my personal final exam for the class which demonstrates some of the topics covered in the class such as arbitrage-free pricing, binomial tree models, measure theory, Ito calculus, the Black-Scholes analysis, derivatives pricing, volatility modeling, and hedging.
